## Viewing Behaviours and Influencing Factors on my Videos

```{r}
logged_data <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTK7ywLH3MKyb7NiCMnqwT6HkfGp_B5lsd0mZYQTldmmumqmyCv8o7HRkiRqfUCAHfSrtzhJtG5ec8L/pub?output=csv"

         watch_reason = 3,

         watch_more = 6,
         found_video = 7,
         multitasking = 8,
         videos_watched = 9)

```

There are `r amount_videos` values in this observational log. Interestingly, I only searched up videos that were very long (30+ minutes), I did not click on very long videos in my recommended feed or those that were shared with me. These very long videos were all audio books that I specifically searched for when I was in the mood to re-listen to a novel for the nostalgia. The largest  amount of videos I watched per day was `r max_videos`, this was a day where I was stressed from university work. Another interesting theme in my data was that there was a strong relationship between multitasking and watching the video in full. In almost every instance that I had been multitasking I did not watch the full video.
