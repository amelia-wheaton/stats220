## Viewing Behaviours and Influencing Factors on my Videos

```{r}
logged_data <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTK7ywLH3MKyb7NiCMnqwT6HkfGp_B5lsd0mZYQTldmmumqmyCv8o7HRkiRqfUCAHfSrtzhJtG5ec8L/pub?output=csv"

latest_data <- read_csv(logged_data) %>%
  rename(watch_time = 2,
         watch_reason = 3,
         video_format = 4,
         watched_full = 5,
         watch_more = 6,
         found_video = 7,
         multitasking = 8,
         videos_watched = 9)

print(latest_data)
latest_data %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = video_format, fill = videos_watched)) +

       subtitle = "Comparing Video finds to Amount of Videos Watched",
       caption = "Source: Youtube Viewing Log",

       y = "Count")

latest_data %>%

  geom_bar(aes(x = multitasking, fill = watched_full)) +

There are `r amount_videos` values in this observational log. Interestingly, I only searched up videos that were very long (30+ minutes), I did not click on very long videos in my recommended feed or those that were shared with me. These very long videos were all audio books that I specifically searched for when I was in the mood to re-listen to a novel for the nostalgia. 
Another interesting theme in my data was that there was a strong relationship between multitasking and watching the video in full. In almost every instance that I had been multitasking I did not watch the full video.
